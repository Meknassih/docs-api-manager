Run This Example

Notebooks are a way to create tutorials and examples with runnable code samples.

What do notebooks look like? You're reading one right now.

----
// Run this code by pushing the play button.
// Or you can edit it.
demo = ['great', 'interactive'];
'Notebooks are a ' + demo[0] + ' way to create ' + demo[1] + ' tutorials.';
----


Notebooks are also a powerful way to explore APIs. When you import a RAML file you can explore an API's endpoints, make requests (even with OAuth), and view the response.

Here's an example of a very simple API:

----
// Import a simple (and fictional) Songs API:
API.createClient('songs', 'https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/repository/v2/organizations/38f6c050-2ea4-409a-949a-adf91c3c5de2/public/apis/179375683/versions/11935560/files/songs.raml');
----

----
// Explore the API with typeahead: add a "." after 'songs'
songs
----

The typeahead reveals that "albums", "artists", and "songs" are available. Let's access a particular song:

----
// The song's details will be in the response body.
songs.songs.songId('3').get();
----

Explore the API on your own by changing the code above, or try our examples for link:github-sample-api-notebook.adoc[Github], link:instagram-sample-api-notebook.adoc[Instagram], or link:twitter-sample-api-notebook.adoc[Twitter].

Please read our API Guide for details about using APIs with the Notebook. Want to explore your own API? Create a RAML file.
